# COSI Website Source Code

This is the source code for the COSI website!
In true spirit of the organization, the code is also open source.

Built on top of https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/

Which is well documented and recommend checking out.

## Local Debug and Refreshing

> zola serve

## Building for Files

> zola build

But it is recommended to just use their github actions:
